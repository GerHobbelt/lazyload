/*
There's some serious issues with load order when loading multiple JavaScript files and depending
on this 'load order' IN ANY WAY in either 'page internal scripts' or other JavaScript external
files, which are loaded separately.
(After all, it's not all the time that you can dump all JS loads together in one flattened
external <script>...)

So what we do here is provide a little and quite rude 'service' which is to expect the
'internal script' already to have been executed (or at least parsed) and invoke a
predefined function made available in there: for 'regular use' we expect a running Combiner
(combine.inc.php) which will accept an optional 'cb' argument pointing the the function which
must be run next to execute the lazy-load cycle. This idea is inspired by the way google
takes care of this load order issue in their translator JavaScript code:

    <script>
    function googleTranslateElementInit()
    {
        new google.translate.TranslateElement({
                pageLanguage: 'en',
                layout: google.translate.TranslateElement.InlineLayout.HORIZONTAL
            }, 'google_translate_element');
    }
    </script>
    <script src="//translate.google.com/translate_a/element.js?cb=googleTranslateElementInit"></script>

Unfortunately, when we're loading JS in the installer we CANNOT assume the Combiner to assist us, so
we code for a default callback here with a quite unique name:
    ccms_lazyload_setup_GHO();
If that function exists, it is executed at the end of this script. (And yes, we can assume the function
exists when it is contained in the HTML page itself.


When we use the 'lazy loader' for ALL the JavaScript stuff we can guarantee load order and
make sure the 'page internal script bits' can provide us with those much needed special
configuration bits.

The way to accomplish this is by having all external JS scripts 'lazy loaded' and, where needed,
have them invoke functions and stuff defined in the page itself.

except for his mistake to check like this:

  if (window.function_name) ...

instead of using the typeof, the idea is good. The direct check turned out to break on FF3.6


This check and invocation MUST happen in this lazyload.js: we can only guarantee this lazy loader
is indeed 'loaded' itself, when it is the ONLY external JavaScript file we depend on in our HTML page.

From here, the lazy loader will take over and make sure the other scripts get loaded and in the
prescribed order!
